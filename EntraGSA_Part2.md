#### Part 1 for the basics

Part 2 will focus on extending the usecase to running SMB over GSA. 

#### 1. Why ? 


Good point. SMB is actually just as old as yours truly - It was developed back in good ol' 1983. Great year. 
Even today a lot of companies are still struggling with traditional Fileshares to organize their workflows. Some organizations are simply stuck with it because changing to modern alternatives is considered too costly or disruptive to the business. Who wants to be that manager that prioritizes to optimize operations instead of growing the business, right ? yeah. thatâ€™s what your predecessors thought too ;-) ..... 

That leaves us with no modern protocol, no modern authentication & cool stuff like Conditional Access, and in practice limited encryption due to backwards compatibility requirements. As you can tell, I'm a huge fan of SMB Fileshares in Modern Work environments :-) 
The biggest challenge in the post covid world is that we no longer default to the office as our primary work location. And to extend SMB into any location either requires a complete network setup, a VPN topology or worse, a full-blown VDI environment.

Enter Entra Global Secure Access. Microsoft's answer to a SSE. As covered previously, Global Secure Access (GSA) offers a nifty reversed proxy that allows us to tunnel specific (very specific) applications between a modern endpoint and in this case a legacy Fileshare over the Internet. Best of all is the wealth of other Entra features like the Conditional Access Framework that are included. In other words - I can set conditions for accessing a legacy share over the Internet. SMB sounds a whole lot better now :-).


### 2. (any)Fileserver over GSA
